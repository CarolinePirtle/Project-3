Programming Project
For this group project, you can define your own custom web or mobile app. It must use a technology we
haven’t learned in class. One of the goals of this class if for you to learn how to pick up new technologies
quickly. Here is your chance to learn a new framework or library and apply it to a project of your choice.
The project and the technology must be approved before Thanksgiving break.
Here are some new technology suggestions, and you don’t have to use any of these technologies. If you
have something you want to learn and it’s not on this list, go for it.
New Web Technology Options:
Express, Angular, Firebase, WordPress, AWS Amplify.
If you’d like to build a React application, you must connect it to a backend like Firebase or Express. You
can also choose to use a data API, but it must be approved first.
New Mobile App Technology Options:
Native Android or iOS app.
If you’d like to build a React Native app, you must connect it to a backend like Firebase. You can also
choose to use a data API, but it must be approved first.
Reading the documentation of a new framework like Angular and doing a substantial online tutorial for
any of these new technologies is acceptable. This project is an opportunity for you to take the skills
we’ve learned in class, build on them and create an app or learn a new technology that interests you
and your team. Have fun with it!
You can choose to work in groups of up to 3 people.
Part 1: Project Description and Team Members
Please submit a short description of your app including the planned technologies that will be used in the
app. Also include the team members and who will be responsible for what. This will be graded as P/F
and is due on Tuesday, November 21 at 5pm. Everyone in the group should submit the description so I
know everyone is in a group and has a project.
GitHub, Documentation, and Demo (25 points)
You should collaborate with your team using a GitHub repository. One member of the team should
create a new GitHub repository to store the final project. Make sure to add all teammates as
collaborators.
In addition to your code, submit a one page summary.pdf file – this should contain the name and
description of your project, the actual work breakdown (who did what), a link to your project and a link
to your GitHub repository.
All teams will do a short demo (5 - 10 minutes) of their project on December 6th for the T/R section and
December 11th for the M/W sections during class time.
Grading Criteria
75% for functionality –the app works as described without any errors.
15% for documentation and demo.
10% for Git/GitHub usage – Did you use Git well? Do you have good commit messages?
Submission Instructions
Have one person per group create a zip file containing all the code. To Blackboard, submit:
1. The zip file.
2. summary.pdf – make sure this is separate and not in the zip file. This way we can view the
summary in Blackboard and don’t have to unzip the code unless necessary.
3. Put a link to the GitHub team repository in the comments section on Blackboard.
